Dracolotl
 
A small mod that adds the ability to hatch the Dragon Egg into a Dracolotl, a loyal pet that can fly, attack your foes, and be bucketed.

- Dracolotl
* Can be summoned by creating a pattern on the ground meant to resemble the portal to the Overworld that the Dragon Egg spawns on in the End. This is the minimum required:
	    0		    0 <- 1 block of Obsidian or Bedrock with End Crystal on top (it's the End Crystal that's important)
			        1 <- 3 blocks of Obsidian with a Dragon Egg on top.
    0   1   0
	
	    0
When the Dragon Egg is interacted with while the pattern is complete, some particles and sounds will play, and a Dracolotl will be spawned, tamed by whoever hatched it. The End Crystals and Dragon Egg will be consumed.
